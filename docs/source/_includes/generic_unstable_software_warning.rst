   Warns users of unstable (commercial) microscope control software.


.. admonition:: Microscope control software can be unstable
    :class: warning

    Advanced software features in commercial microscope control software are
    often somewhat unstable, as they are not the manufacturer's focus and lack
    extensive user feedback. Manufacturers / facilities also tend to update
    software in ways that can break advanced uses. DySTrack users should be 
    aware that this can be a source of unexpected issues.

    If you encounter microscope updates or changes to macro interfaces that
    affect DySTrack, we appreciate receiving a report as an Issue `on GitHub`_, 
    but please note that we can promise neither quick fixes nor long-term 
    support.

    We recommend working with your manufacturer rep to resolve problems.
