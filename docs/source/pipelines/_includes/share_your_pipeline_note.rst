.. Note encouraging the sharing of newly developed pipelines via GitHub


.. admonition:: Please share your work!
    :class: note

    If you build a DySTrack image analysis pipeline that could be of interest
    for others, please consider sharing your work with the community by adding
    it to the DySTrack repo. You can do so during/after publication, if this is
    a constraint.

    If you would like to add a pipeline, please open an issue `on GitHub`_.
