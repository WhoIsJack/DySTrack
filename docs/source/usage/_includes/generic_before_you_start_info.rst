* **Ensure you have permission to use DySTrack on this microscope**

  .. admonition:: Risk of damage
    :class: warning

    Modern microscopes are expensive machines, and automating them comes with
    an inherent risk of damage. Do not run DySTrack without permission from the
    microscope's administrator, and always ask for help if you are unsure about 
    something.


* **Confirm that DySTrack has been installed and tested**

  Otherwise, see :doc:`Installation</intro/installation>`.


* **Confirm that a suitable image analysis pipeline for your experiment is 
  available**

  See :doc:`Available DySTrack pipelines</pipelines/available>` for an overview
  of existing pipelines that come with the DySTrack repo. For information on
  how to develop your own custom pipeline (advanced), we recommend reviewing
  the :doc:`Anatomy of DySTrack pipelines</pipelines/anatomy>` and 
  :doc:`Developing DySTrack pipelines</pipelines/develop>` sections.
