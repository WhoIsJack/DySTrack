  .. admonition:: Risk of damage
    :class: warning

    Modern microscopes are expensive machines, and automating them comes with
    an inherent risk of damage. Do not run DySTrack without permission from the
    microscope's administrator, and always ask for help if you are unsure about 
    something.


* **Confirm that DySTrack has been installed and tested**

  Otherwise, see :doc:`Installation</intro/installation>`.


* **Confirm that a suitable image analysis pipeline for your experiment is 
  available**

  See :doc:`Developing DySTrack pipelines</develop/index>` for information 
  on how to develop new pipelines (advanced).
