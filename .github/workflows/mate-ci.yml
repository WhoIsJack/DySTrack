# Continuous Integration workflow for MATE
# On a push or on creation of a pull request to branches main or ci_dev, this 
# workflow will install python and MATE (along with dependencies) and run black
# isort, and pytest.

    # add an extend-exclude kwarg to pyproject.toml that stops black from
    # looking at folders we don't want checked. But for now, I want folders 
    # like prototype and macros excluded here, but not in pyproject.toml...
    # Update: Seems like use_pyproject is only supported for python 3.11 or
    # higher, so for now I guess this should stay as it is anyways.
