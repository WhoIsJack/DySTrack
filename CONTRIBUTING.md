## Asking for help or contributing to DySTrack

We welcome Issues and Pull Requests that:

- Report or fix a bug or other problem
- Ask a question not answered in [the Documentation](https://whoisjack.github.io/DySTrack/)
- Fix or improve something in the documentation
- (Aim to) add a new image analysis pipeline
- (Aim to) add support for an unsupported microscope
- Suggest or make (backwards-compatible) improvements to features or performance

When raising an Issue or PR, please give it a clear title and description, and 
include as much relevant information as possible.

For PRs, please follow the conventions in the existing code base as closely as
possible, use `black` and `isort` for code formatting and numpy-style doc 
strings, and include/update unit tests and the documentation as necessary. 

That said, if you are unsure how to do these things, please raise an Issue or 
PR anyway and just ask for support! If we find the time, we are happy to help;
after all, most of us are scientists (not professional software developers),
and we are all always still learning!

*Disclaimer:* We currently cannot guarantee any level of support whatsoever and
retain full discretion to close Issues or reject Pull Requests for any reason.
Nevertheless, we do aspire to be helpful and responsive to the extent our 
limited resources permit.

All interactions must abide by the [Contributor Covenenat Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
